## **ðŸ“Œ Overview** 
ZeroDay-SentinalAI is a framework powered by AI with the potential to revolutionize cybersecurity by addressing one of the most challenging aspects of threat detectionâ€”unknown vulnerabilities.

## Project Architecture
The framework consists of six key components that work together to detect and mitigate zero-day attacks:

- **Data Collection Module**: Gathers system metrics to establish behavioral baselines.
- **AI Model Training Module**: Implements multiple AI algorithms for anomaly detection.
- **Real-time Monitoring Module**: Continuously checks system behavior against the baseline.
- **Response Engine**: Automatically mitigates detected threats.
- **Web Dashboard**: Provides real-time visualization of system security status.
- **Framework Integration**: Ties all components together into a cohesive system.

## AI Techniques Used
This framework leverages multiple AI approaches for comprehensive security:

### 1. Unsupervised Learning
- **Isolation Forest**: Efficiently detects outliers by randomly selecting features and isolating observations.
- **DBSCAN Clustering**: Identifies dense regions of normal behavior and flags outliers.

### 2. Deep Learning
- **Autoencoder Neural Networks**: Learns the normal system behavior pattern and identifies deviations by measuring reconstruction error.

### 3. Ensemble Methods
- Uses a consensus-based approach combining multiple detection models to reduce false positives.

### 4. Anomaly Scoring
- Implements normalized scoring across different detection methods to quantify the severity of potential threats.

### 5. Automated Incident Analysis
- Uses clustering techniques to group similar incidents for pattern recognition.

## Future Enhancements
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implement reinforcement learning for adaptive response strategies.
- **Federated Learning**: Enable secure knowledge sharing across multiple deployments.
- **Explainable AI Components**: Add interpretability to anomaly detection results.
- **Adversarial Training**: Improve robustness against evasion techniques.
- **Transfer Learning**: Apply knowledge from known attacks to detect novel variations.

## Security Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: The framework processes only system metrics, not content data.
- **Attack Surface**: The dashboard should be deployed on a secure network.
- **False Positives**: Thresholds are customizable to balance security and usability.
